# SPRT

This applet was designed by Krissi Alari as apart of her senior capstone at Cal State Monterey Bay. This applet was designed specifically to use the SPRT for E. coli testing in lettuce for a particular food testing company. The re-paramterization option of risk levels is only applicable for their testing purposes. The rest of the applet (using "Average (Î¼)" as the parameter of interest) is suitable for general use of the SPRT.

The applet is live at https://kalari.shinyapps.io/SPRT/
